# Simple Money Counter
A simple money paper counter based on user's input of amount<br/>

## How it works
Amount of the input will then be separated into how many available fractions needed to make that amount, in the most minimum total of fractions possible.

Each input will be calculated immediately on input change, so there's no need to submit each time.
