# Simple Money Counter
A simple money paper counter based on user's input of amount<br/>

## How it works
Amount of the input will then be separated into how many available fractions needed to make that amount, in the most minimum total of fractions possible.

~~Each input will be calculated immediately on input change, so there's no need to submit each time.~~

## How to run the project locally
1. First off, clone this repo
2. Open the directory of the cloned repo
3. Run ```yarn``` on the root of the project directory
4. Run ```yarn start``` to start the local server. Your default browser will fire up ```localhost:3000``` afterwards.
